# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCE_DATA

Completed this project as part of my Value added course Mastering BI with PowerBi with United Network of Professionals (UNP)

In this project, I leveraged Microsoft Power BI to design and develop an interactive financial data dashboard, delivering actionable insights through comprehensive analysis. Each dashboard was accompanied by a detailed summary of insights, offering strategic recommendations for data-driven decision-making. This project showcases my ability to handle financial data, create impactful visualizations, and provide meaningful business insights.
